'but it\'s certainly strange how you randomly run in to people you have not seen in years , in little hole-in-the-walls in europe','',positive
'fun times','',positive
'and this particular piece was by far the best play i have ever seen','',positive
'it was also incredibly simple , cutting the normally huge cast down to only seven performers','',positive
'it\'s moments like that that remind me why i ve chosen theatre as a profession','',neutral
'i was lucky enough to be able to stay with some friends to cut down on the cost , and see a different side of london life','',positive

'loved london','',positive
'loved the free museums','',positive
'especially the british museum','',neutral
'soooo many monuments , including two statues in front of buckingham palace that had a conspicuous communist message','',neutral

'now i have a confession to make : before the world cup began i had actually never seen an entire soccer game from start to finish','',neutral

'then there were the brazilians , everywhere , singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures , and of course the pale and pasty brits with their cock-eyed stares and drinking songs','',positive
'loads of fun','',positive
'i did not have tickets to any of the games , but my group of friends would always go to a cafe or bar of the nationality that was playing to watch the match','',neutral
'so to a french cafe for the france-swiss game , a tapas bar when spain played , drank caiprinhas with the passionate brazilians , etc . it was a colorful and hilarious way to take part without fighting the crowds','',positive
'another interesting element was the latent patriotism that emerged during the cup','',positive
'now this merits explaining : before the world cup began , if you waved a german flag in the streets , you would probably be called a nazi and at the very least labeled as a radical right wing nutter','',neutral
'and for what it\'s worth i agree with them , it makes me nervous too','',negative
so,'',neutral
'people were genuinely excited about supporting their national team , and taking pride in its accomplishments','',positive
'now this newfound enthusiasm certainly was not shared by everyone','',positive
'and of course no one can laboriously dissect an idea better than the germans','',neutral
'in june i had also been training at work to lead tours of sachsenhausen concentration camp , which i started at the end of the month','',neutral

'the city is a sweaty , dirty , polluted hole','',negative
'take your impression of a squalor-filled mediterranean capital , and add this to your image : 10 story apartment buildings everywhere , in 100 degree heat , all cooled by wall-mounted air conditioners , a.k.a. swamp boxes','',neutral
'now imagine the condensation from thousands of swamp box coolers pitter pattering on your head as you stroll down the trashy athens streets','',negative
'now add a couple of poorly placed ancient columns','',neutral
'and the city itself really is lovely , in it\'s own way','',positive
'but two days back to back was more than enough','',neutral
'now this was really amazing','',positive
'it took us about two hours to get out there , and then we climbed around and played on the rocks for about an hour , taking pics of the magnificent old temple ruin that is literally clinging to the cliff face','',neutral

'we stayed in a tiny mountain village called droushia , and these people brought hospitality to incredible new heights','',positive
'they did everything they could to make us feel welcome , everything from putting us up in a beautiful hotel , refusing to let us pay for anything , and making sure that our stay on their island was as enchanting as the stories always make it out to be','',positive
'tomorrow we will go somewhere special .','',neutral
'the next morning , the last day of the festival , they piled us all into four wheel drive vehicles , and took us off the map to an area that i will henceforth be labeling the blue lagoon','',neutral

'our hosts had brought along a lunch of fresh fruit and we broke our fast on a cliff overlooking the whole gorgeous expanse','',neutral
'it was really interesting staying with them in this little mountain village , and getting to experience a bit of what their culture was all about','',positive
'oh and the food is incredible','',positive
'but not feta','',neutral
'haloumi has nothing to do with feta','',neutral
'its really a testament to the vision of the ancients that in our world of skyscrapers and technical gadgetry , we are still fascinated by a two thousand year-old arrangement of stones','',positive
'after returning from greece my last few weeks in berlin passed very quickly','',neutral
'the time flew by and before i knew it , august was at an end and my doorstep was graced by my best friend lance , who had come to berlin for my last week','',neutral

'the city is incredibly beautiful , tucked into the alps and right on the water','',positive
'i think the most important thing i can say about this city , is that all of the rumors : that the city\'s dirty , the people are rude , the language barrier is insurmountable , the metro is incomprehensible , you things will be stolen , that they hate americans','',negative
'it\'s called the city of love and light for a reason','',neutral
'the eiffel tower is breathtaking , and seeing it in person destroys its cliche and makes you fall in love with the thing','',positive
'the people are absolutely lovely','',positive
'we encountered so many genuinely wonderful , helpful , content people','',positive
'everything from trying to order a baguette in the morning ( my francais is tres terrible ) to asking directions or talking to cabbies , we were always pleasantly surprised at how open and welcoming they were','',positive
'and they all seem to really enjoy their city','',positive
'they know how beautiful it is , and they appreciate it','',positive
'and man , it is gorgeous','',positive
'and people are out in them all the time','',neutral

'we found out when we headed over to two of these chairs that were situated in the shade , and plopped down','',neutral
'we looked around and noticed that there were lots of people all over the park , in the municipal nap chairs , taking a snooze','',neutral

'actually , i think maybe the best thing about spx is how everyone is kind of pressed together , comics placed near one another seemingly without much concern for subject matter coherency ( i heard it was a bit different in prior years , with multiple selling rooms and all ); if the creators in attendance and the books on display were not a comprehensive picture of english-language non-superhero comics , there was at least enough diversity to manage the illusion of comprehensiveness','',neutral

'welcome to the world of classical music','',neutral
'it\'s my world , a place where music in endless forms and varieties give me an entire lifetime of listening pleasure','',positive
'since classical music is the oldest and largest genre of music in existence , let\'s study this music from one era to the next','',neutral
1,'',neutral
'our first composers were mostly supported by the church ( surprise ! ) , and religion influenced early classical music more than any other source','',positive
'there was no formal system of notation , making composing very difficult and time-consuming','',neutral
2,'',neutral
'music became more of an expressive art than a science , and music was now being printed , allowing sacred , secular , and instrumental music to spread everywhere','',neutral
'claudio montiverdi was one of the most prominent composers of this era','',neutral
'baroque ( 1600-1750 ): the era of bach , handel , and vivaldi saw the development of almost every modern instrument in use today , particularly the violin , clarinet , and piano','',neutral
'composers used counterpoint , dance rhythms and repetition in their music','',neutral
'think of this brief period as a launch platform of all the modern music to follow','',neutral
'just kidding','',positive
'you can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era , namely mozart and beethoven ( both of whom did not know they were writing \" classical \" )','',neutral
5,'',neutral
'composers of this era such as tchaikovsky , brahms , and chopin wrote music with a wider dynamic range , using a larger variety of instruments','',neutral
6,'',neutral
'new subcategories of classical music were born every year , and more composers were writing music than all previous eras combined','',neutral
'and anything and everything was possible , from atonal to experimental to electronic','',neutral
'over one hundred thousand composers fall into this period , including copland , stravinsky , and ravel','',neutral
7,'',neutral
'welcome to the contemporary classical period , where we see even more subcategories such as the minimalism of philip glass , the electric opera by john corigliano , and the twelve-tone works of john bilotta , a bay area composer','',neutral
'that was painless , was not it','',neutral
'your next few leaps into classical music should now be a little easier','',neutral
'add a little passion to your life each time you visit , and share my world with me','',neutral
'arguments in favor : 2','',neutral
'8 of the \" pro \" arguments consist of someone listing what i take to be every single county in oregon from which there are no appellate judges','',neutral
'there\'s all kinds of thought about how the measure will make judicial positions more or less political , whether those positions already are political , whether it matters that the oregon constitution originally had district elections and switched to statewide some time ago , whether elections by district mean that some of the judges will be less qualified than others could have been or whether it means that currently underrepresented areas ( think every rural area ) will have a better chance to have someone who understands them in the appellate courts , etc','',neutral
'one of the few that seemed to me to say something worth saying was an argument in favor that was written by ron saxton','',neutral
'this surprised me , because i know from tv ads that ron saxton is running for something or other','',positive
'the one other somewhat-convincing argument was immediately after that one , also in favor , by an organization of oregon farmers','',neutral

'the odd thing about body worlds is that it goes from being an anatomy exhibit to being a sort of cadaver carnival of bizarre art','',positive
'again , i am no judge of art , and the fact that this exhibit has drawn record numbers of people hint at the possibility that i am off-base','',neutral
'now , people can see that organs are not the cartoonish objects that one sees in a book','',neutral

'as an aside , there have been some interesting articles regarding the aquisition of cadavers for exhibits such as body worlds ( i guess the entire affair has sparked various \" knock-off \" exhibits !','',neutral
